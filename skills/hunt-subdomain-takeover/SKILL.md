description: "Hunt subdomain takeover — DNS points to a deprovisioned external service (S3 bucket, GitHub Pages site, Heroku app, Azure Cloudapp, Shopify, Fastly, Tumblr, etc.) that you can register/claim. Detection: dig + cname + http checks for known fingerprint strings. 27+ provider fingerprints: NoSuchBucket (S3), There isn't a GitHub Pages site here, no-such-app.herokuapp.com, NotFound (Azure), Sorry, this shop is currently unavailable (Shopify), Fastly error: unknown domain. Tools: subzy, subjack, takeover.py — but always manually verify before claiming. Standalone severity: Low/Medium (informational unless escalated). Critical chain: subdomain takeover at OAuth redirect_uri = auth code theft = ATO; takeover at session-cookie domain = session hijack across legit subdomains; takeover at email DNS (DKIM/SPF) = email spoofing. Validate: actual takeover claim + chain to real impact. Use when hunting subdomain takeover candidates, when DNS recon reveals stale CNAMEs."

## 15. SUBDOMAIN TAKEOVER
> Quick wins. $200–$3K. Systematic and automatable.

### Detection
```bash
# Dangling CNAMEs
cat /tmp/subs.txt | dnsx -silent -cname -resp | grep "CNAME" | tee /tmp/cnames.txt

# Automated detection
nuclei -l /tmp/subs.txt -t ~/nuclei-templates/takeovers/ -o /tmp/takeovers.txt
```

### Quick-Kill Fingerprints
```
"There isn't a GitHub Pages site here"  → GitHub Pages — register the repo
"NoSuchBucket"                          → AWS S3 — create the bucket
"No such app"                           → Heroku — create the app
"404 Web Site not found"                → Azure App Service
"Fastly error: unknown domain"          → Fastly CDN
"project not found"                     → GitLab Pages
```

### Impact Escalation
```
Basic takeover                    → Low/Medium
+ Cookies (domain=.target.com)    → High (credential theft)
+ OAuth redirect_uri registered   → Critical (ATO)
+ CSP allowlist entry             → Critical (XSS anywhere)
```
